In this notebook, our primary objective was to identify hazardous asteroids using various machine learning models. I explored different algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
and other important models, to tackle this classification problem.

I added new columns in the dataset extracted from the existing features in the dataset, studied the relation between different features with the help of pairplot and heatmap provided by
sckit-learn library, which helped in getting very good insights about the data.

Throughout our analysis, I performed extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. I leveraged the power of SVM models, which are well-suited for 
complex classification tasks, and compared their performance with other prominent models.

Key Findings:
- After thorough evaluation, I discovered that SVM models, such as Linear, Polynomial, Sigmoid, RBF, Gaussian Kernels, exhibited strong performance in identifying hazardous asteroids.
- Feature engineering played a crucial role in improving the model accuracy, as we carefully selected and engineered relevant features based on domain knowledge and feature
 importance analysis.
- We also evaluated and compared the performance of other important models Random Forest Classifier, KNN algorithm, Adaboost Classifier, SVM models, Gridsearch CV , XgBoost Classifier
 on each of these models, providing a comprehensive analysis of different approaches.

Insights and Recommendations:
- Our findings highlight the significance of machine learning techniques in identifying hazardous asteroids, contributing to the field of planetary science and asteroid risk assessment.
- The SVM models, in particular, demonstrated promising results and could be further optimized and deployed in real-time asteroid monitoring systems.
- To enhance the model's predictive capabilities, additional feature engineering, such as incorporating orbital parameters or celestial body characteristics, could be explored.
- Collaborative efforts with domain experts and researchers in the field can lead to further advancements and refinements in the models used for asteroid classification.

Future Work:
- Further research can focus on exploring advanced machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning models, to improve the accuracy and precision of hazard identification.
- Integration of additional data sources, such as telescopic images or spectral data, can provide richer information for enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.
- Continual model monitoring and updates are crucial to ensure the robustness and reliability of the hazard classification system as new data becomes available.

By addressing the problem of identifying hazardous asteroids through various SVM models and other important models, we have made significant progress in mitigating
the risks associated with near-Earth objects. Our findings contribute to the broader field of space exploration and help in protecting our planet.
