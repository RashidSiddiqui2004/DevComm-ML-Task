# DevComm-ML-Task
Hi everyone,

I am Rashid, an IT undergraduate at NSUT,Dwarka.
This is my resporitory for the DevComm ML Tasks for the recruitment process in this prestigious Tech society.

In the first task, I was assigned a binary classification problem on the heavenly objects around the Earth. They had to be classified as Hazardous or non-Hazardous objects. I was also provided with the dataset through the Kaggle website.
Link to the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects

In the second task, I had to create a website through which users can interact with chatbot to perform various tasks.

I really enjoyed and learnt so many things in succesfully accomplishing these two tasks.

Thank you,

DevComm, NSUT
