Chatbot Project
This project is a chatbot implementation using the OpenAI API for various task-specific purposes, including name suggestion (Company name, store name,
pet name,Superhero name), customer service, and doubt resolution.

Overview
The chatbot project aims to leverage the power of Deep Learning and the OpenAI API to create intelligent conversational agents. By utilizing the OpenAI API, the chatbot can generate human-like responses to user inputs.

Features
The implemented chatbot system includes the following task-specific chatbots:

Name Suggesting Chatbot: A chatbot that provides suggestions for names based on given criteria or preferences.

Customer Service Chatbot: A chatbot designed to assist users with common customer service inquiries and support requests.

Doubt Resolver Chatbot: A chatbot capable of answering questions and resolving doubts related to specific topics, such as computer science concepts.

Technologies Used
The chatbot project primarily utilizes the following technologies:

OpenAI API: The OpenAI API is used for natural language processing and generating chatbot responses.

Programming Language: Python is used as the primary programming language for implementing the chatbot system.

Usage
To use the chatbot system, follow these steps:

Set up OpenAI API: Obtain an API key from OpenAI and configure it in the project.

Install Dependencies: Install the required Python dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the Chatbot: Execute the main script, such as python main.py, to start the chatbot system.
Use the command - flask run.

Interact with the Chatbot: Enter user inputs or queries in the command line interface and observe the chatbot's responses.
